# transmission-client

A Haskell wrapper for Transmission RPC protocol, as specified in <https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/rpc-spec.txt>. The major/minor version number corresponds with Transmission release version. Use `haddock` to generate detailed documentation.

This package is a subproject of [pt-helper](../README.md). To use this package alone, it is recommended that you use `stack` with the same Stackage resolver of `pt-helper` (usually [latest LTS](https://www.stackage.org/lts)).
